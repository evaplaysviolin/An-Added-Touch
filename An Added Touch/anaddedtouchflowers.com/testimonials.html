Dear Carol,<br>
Now that the wedding and holiday festivities are over, I wanted to thank you for the beautiful, beautiful floral arrangements you designed and created for our wedding at the Hotel Drisco and our dinner at Gary Danko. You did a fabulous job! We were so happy with your work. And our guests were so impressed, especially with the arrangements at Gary Danko. Going with red instead of white was definitely the right move!<br>
<br>
I hope all is going well for you!<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Julie Sakaue-Cheng<br>

Dear Carol,<br>
Jeff and I are writing to thank you for the truly perfect floral arrangements at our wedding. From the beginning of the day when I entered the bride's room to find my own stunning bouquet, to my arrival at the reception when I first saw the many pots of flowers, I was amazed. Having specified only a few varieties of flowers out of the many you used, I was trusting your personal taste and style based soley on what I had seen in pictures--I was in no way disappointed. Had I chosen all the flowers myself, I would not have benefited from your experience and we certainly would have had far less interesting and beautiful arrangements. Your choices were exquisite, the color scheme stunning and unique and I heard as much from many of our guests. Furthermore, I should tell you that working with you was extremely easy. You are organized and responsive, and I appreciate your willingness to work with us for the best result. In the end, I am amazed that with only two meetings and a smatering of emails, you understood what we wanted and provided exceptional service. Thank you, Carol. Please feel free to reference us for future clients--we have nothing but positive things to say about your work.<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
Joyce Leary and Jeff Zimmer<br>

Dear Carol,<br>
Thank you so much for the absolutely wonderful job you did with our wedding flowers. I can't begin to describe how beautiful they were and all the compliments we received on them. I was so pleased with how you really brought my color theme to life. It broke my heart not to be able to bring home all the arrangements at the end of the night. I'd also like to thank you for being so friendly to my friends Mel & Sunny, who were acting as my coordinators for the day. They told me you were by far the best wedding vendor they dealt with that day. Thank you again and I apologize for the tardiness of this note. I would highly recommend your services to any bride so please let me know if you ever need a referral. <br>
<br>
All the best,<br>

Rob and I wanted to thank you so much for the incredible job you did on the flowers and candles. It was absolutely amazing! When I first went downstairs and saw the tables I seriously had tears in my eyes. It was gorgeous. The guests could not stop commenting on how beautiful the centerpieces were. If you ever need to give a potential client a reference please give them my name and number!!<br>
<br>
Thank you again,<br>

Dear Carol, <br>
I'm so sorry that this is so late, but we've been away on our honeymoon in Ireland. I wanted to thank you for all of your patience and hard work towards our wedding. I can't tell you how many times I've been asked about my flowers, that day and still today!! They were better than I had ever dreamed of. I have dried many and put into a memory box and they look wonderful Thank you so much you really are the best. <br>
<br>
Always, Patty Dunn<br>
